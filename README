Aloke - a tool for generating random words similar to existing words

To use this tool, first generate a probability array using prob_calc.py:
1) Change file_path to your file
2) If necessary, adjust the file importing process so that "words" is a list of strings
3) Run prob_calc.py

Then generate words by running word_gen.py



Why "aloke"?
I saw it painted on the side of a railway car and thought it would be an excellent randomly generated name.
